# Convolutional Neural Network Financial Data

Applying CNN to the financial data - specifically I want to use recession indicators together with readily available information from yahoo finance, such as open, close, low, high, volume and other standard price metrics. Moreover information retrieved from FRED to model long-term trends using macroeconomic data. \\

The goal of the network is to apply feature engineering techniques learned from 'Advances in Financial Machin Learning' by Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado as well as theory obtained from 'Deep Learning' by Ian Goodfellow.
